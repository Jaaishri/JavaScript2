// Add your explanation as a comment here

/* In the first function:
- The variable x is assign to 9, the function increment 9 to 10. But since x is a const variable when console.log calls for x, the function prints out the const variable value which is 9.
 In the second function: 
- variable y is an object, the function use the key x to change the value of 9. It increment it to 10 and assign it to x. when the console.log calls for y, variable y finds the x and the value 10 which is assigned to it. */
